\chapter{Introduction}

The implementation of a programming language---be it an interpreter or a compiler---tends to be divided into phases, each dealing with their own aspect of the language. For example, a parser details the syntax of the language, while name resolution handles names, scoping, and namespaces. A type checker details part of the semantics, how different language constructions can be combined. This means that the implementation of any single language construction is spread throughout the language implementation, necessitating it be considered as a whole. Adding a new construction requires changes in many places.

Some languages include methods to add new constructions within the language itself, without extending the implementation; one important one being macros \cite{plt-tr1,Hickey2008,Matsakis2014}. Macros add new constructions by defining them in terms of previously existing constructions. Evaluation proceeds by expanding each macro, possibly recursively, until only base language constructions remain, at which point the program can be evaluated normally.

When looking at macros in languages that are commonly used today a few problems remain however. This thesis will focus on two broad categories of such problems: abstraction (see section \ref{sec:problem-abstraction}) and syntax (see section \ref{sec:problem-syntax}). These problems have been solved separately (see sections \ref{sec:abstraction-solutions} and \ref{sec:syntax-solutions}) as well as in conjunction (see section \ref{sec:full-solutions}). This thesis falls into the second camp and largely addresses both problems, with a new set of trade-offs and a different unit of composition. See section \ref{sec:solution-overview} for an overview and section \ref{sec:thesis-solution} for more details.

\section{Problems of Abstraction} \label{sec:problem-abstraction}

The abstractions provided by macros can easily become leaky abstractions without special care.

\subsection{Name Capture}

A naive macro expander using textual replacement will introduce accidental name capture. For example, given the following macro (using Racket \cite{plt-tr1} syntax) intended to calculate $2a + b$ while computing $a$ only once:

\begin{minted}{racket}
(define-syntax-rule (double-add a b)
  (let ([x a])
    (+ x x b)))
\end{minted}

The following expression will exhibit accidental name capture when macro expansion uses pure textual replacement:

\begin{minted}{racket}
(let ([x 2])
  (double-add 1 x))
; expands to:
(let ([x 2])
  (let ([x 1])
    (double-add x x x)))
; which evaluates to
3
; while our intended semantics would evaluate to:
4
\end{minted}

Notable here is that the above would not produce an error of any kind, the result would simply be silently wrong.

Most macro systems will avoid this problem through various forms of rewriting or more complicated forms of name resolution (e.g. \cite{Flatt:2016:BSS:2837614.2837620} TODO: references), a notable exception being the C preprocessor that makes no such attempt.

\subsection{Errors after Expansion}

In some cases the fully expanded code is incorrect, either because the macro was poorly implemented, or because it was used improperly. For example:

\begin{minted}{racket}
(define-syntax-rule (new-let x e body)
  (let ([x e])
    body))

(new-let 2 x
  (+ 1 x))
\end{minted}

Here we define a new binding construction, but misuse it; the identifier and the value are switched. The macro expansion will succeed and produce the code below, but at that point an error message will be produced about improper use of \mintinline{racket}{let}, even though \mintinline{racket}{let} never occurs in the original code.

\begin{minted}{racket}
(let ([2 x])
  (+ 1 x))
\end{minted}

The error exposes the implementation of the macro. The generated code may be introduced through several layers of macro expansion and can be quite complicated, making the connection between the error message and the actual error even less clear.

In a statically typed language this problem has an additional form: type errors after macro expansion.

\section{Problems of Syntax} \label{sec:problem-syntax}

One advantage of macros is their ability to essentially introduce syntactic sugar to a language at a user level. Despite this most commonly used macro systems place some fairly strict limits on the newly introduced syntax. For example, a C preprocessor macro must be an identifier, possibly followed by an argument list, and a lisp macro must be a list of valid forms started by a symbol.

Such restrictions simplify parsing the language, since it ensures the grammar is fixed and cannot be changed during parsing.

\section{Contributions}

This thesis contributes the following:

\begin{itemize}
  \item A method of specifying the syntax, binding semantics and implementation of a language construction (macro) in a singular location (sections \ref{sec:design-syntax}, \ref{sec:design-bindings} and \ref{sec:design-implementation}).
  \item Proof that macro expansion using the above method terminates, given a finite input (section \ref{sec:proof-termination}).
  \item Proof that macro expansion does not introduce any binding errors (alternatively preservation of $\alpha$-equivalence) (section \ref{sec:proof-no-errors}).
  \item An implementation of a non-trivial subset of JavaScript/Lua (section \ref{sec:imperative-eval}) to evaluate the method's suitability in modeling a typical imperative language.
  \item An implementation of a non-trivial subset of OCaml (section \ref{sec:functional-eval}) to evaluate the method's suitability in modeling a typical functional language, including pattern matching.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sets of Scopes}

The latest iteration of Racket's \cite{plt-tr1} macro expander achieves binding hygiene by using sets of scopes \cite{Flatt:2016:BSS:2837614.2837620}. The previous iteration used a renaming approach, where references were automatially renamed to prevent accidental capture, but the workings and implementation of the method were difficult to follow. In the new method, each binding construction introduces a scope, which is attached to everything in the body. Thus each reference has an attached set of scopes. To find the binding of a particular reference, find bindings whose respective sets are subsets of the reference's set. If there are multiple, pick the one that is a superset of the others. If no such identifier exists, the reference is ambiguous.

To minimize the number of ambiguous cases, each macro definition and macro use attaches a new scope. Even with these two extra scopes ambiguous references are still possible, but according to \textcite{Flatt:2016:BSS:2837614.2837620} they do not appear in practice.

\subsection{$\lambda_m$}

$\lambda_m$ \cite{Herman2010} is an extension of the lambda calculus with macros and macro type signatures. These signatures describe the structure of macro arguments and results, including binding structure, and form an inspirational basis to the approach taken by this thesis in regard to hygiene and name binding.

Some notable differences exist however:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Bindings in $\lambda_m$ macros are always nested, in the sense that bindings are never available outside of the macro that introduced them. In contrast, consider a local variable in e.g. C:
  \begin{minted}{c}
  int foo = 4;
  printf("foo: %d\n", foo);
  \end{minted}
  The local variable \mintinline{c}{foo} is available for the remainder of the scope, potentially long after the declaration has ended. This thesis handles both kinds of binding.
  \item The macro type signatures in this thesis are never fully explicit, they appear spread out through each macro definition amongst other aspects of the definition. $\lambda_m$ in contrast uses a complete type signature for each macro.
\end{itemize}

$\lambda_m$ also introduces definitions of $\alpha$-equivalence and hygiene that do not depend on macro expansion and also place focus on allowing reasoning about unexpanded programs.

\subsection{Romeo}

\textcite{Stansifer2014} introduce Romeo, a language extending $\lambda_m$ by providing full syntax manipulation capabilities while still retaining hygiene. $\lambda_m$ is limited to pattern matching and replacing, while Romeo can manipulate terms as data.

\section{Syntax Solutions} \label{sec:syntax-solutions}

\subsection{SDF}

The syntax definition formalism SDF \cite{Heering1989} is a system with a combined notation for lexical and context-free grammar, along with a parser. Productions are listed individually and may be spread across several files in a very similar fashion to the syntax constructions of this thesis. SDF also uses associativity annotations for operators instead of necessitating a manual rewriting of the grammar.

A specification in SDF is used to generate a lexical grammar and a context-free grammar, both of which are then used for the actual parsing. The productions in the specification also double to describe an abstract syntax tree, which is the end result.

\subsection{Layout-sensitive SDF}

\textcite{Erdweg2013} extend SDF to handle layout-sensitive grammars in a declarative manner through annotations in each production restricting their relative positions. To achieve this they determine a limited subset of possible layout restrictions that are sufficient to describe the rules of most layout-sensitive languages.

\section{Combined Solutions} \label{sec:full-solutions}

\subsection{SoundX}

\textcite{Lorenzen2016} introduce SoundX, a system for specifying syntax and type rules for a base language, and then language extensions through rewritings (macros). Each rewriting also has specified type rules, detailing what is required for a successful type derivation. Through these it can be statically checked that assuming there is a derivation of the original code, then there will be a derivation in the base language of the rewriting, i.e. it can be statically checked that the rewriting is correct as written, and each use can be checked for correctness without actually performing the rewriting. SDF is used for the syntactic specification of languages and language extensions.

SoundX can technically fail during rewriting. Rewriting is done on derivation trees, and the same construct may appear in multiple premises. If those appearances rewrite into different, incompatible, desugarings the process will fail.

\subsection{Copper and Silver}

Copper \cite{VanWyk2007} defines a grammar and a lexical scanner that works in tandem, where the scanner only returns tokens that the grammar defines as valid next tokens given the current state of the parse. It uses a modified LR parsing algorithm. The combination manages to parse more languages, since the scanner can work unambiguously in more cases. Silver \cite{VanWyk2010} uses attribute grammars to specify modular language extensions on some host language, along with guarantees on some of their behaviour under composition \cite{Kaminski2017}. Silver uses Copper for grammar specification.
